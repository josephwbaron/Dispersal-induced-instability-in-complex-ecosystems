Codes to reproduce the figures in the main text

The files in this collection are written in Python (Jupyter notebook format) and in Mathematica.

"nonlinear_rk4_simulation" is the code used to perform simulations of the complex Levin-Segel system. 
It can be used to reproduce Figs. 5 and 6 of the main text.

"eigenvalues_notebook" is the code used to produce the data shown as blue crosses in Fig. 2 of the 
main text. 

"eigenvalue_spectrum_theory" is the code used to produce the red lines for the bulk spectrum 
and to calculate the location of the outliers (red circles) in Fig. 2

"stability_diagram_fig4" and "stability_diagram_fig3b" use the stability in the methods section to 
construct Figs. 3 and 4.

"maxeiegnvaluevsq" produces the data in Fig 2d of the main text
